            <h3>First-year</h3>
            <p>As a freshman, I am still new and have less experience. Therefore, I should focus on learning a basic
                programming language. I want to not only learn new things but also improve my skills further.
                I am looking forward to participating in interesting activities from now on.</p>

            <h3>Second-year</h3>
            <p>Despite growing up in a second year, I still want to study for more knowledge. Until then I may enjoy
                using my free time for relaxing instead of doing something more productive and beneficial to my future.

            <h3>Third-year</h3>
            <p>After the time has passed for 2 years, I think planning to do a project is a good head start for my
                future career.</p>

        <section class="fourth_year">
            <h3>Fourth-year</h3>
            <p>Finally, the last year. I would mostly spend time on a project with my friends. In addition, I would set
                a plan to study at the university for a master's degree before I graduate.</p>
